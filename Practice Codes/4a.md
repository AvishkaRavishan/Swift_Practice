As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the following are the key iOS design guidelines for buttons. Please note that these guidelines may have been updated since then, so it's always a good idea to refer to the official Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) for the most up-to-date information.

Visual Design:
Buttons should have a clear and easily tappable appearance.
Use the appropriate button style based on the context and hierarchy of your interface. iOS provides different button styles like plain, bordered, filled, and more.
Ensure that buttons have enough contrast with the background to maintain legibility and visibility.

Button Text:
Use clear and concise text that describes the button's action.
Prefer the use of title case for button labels.
Avoid truncating button labels, especially in cases where the full text is critical for understanding the action.

Size and Spacing:
Provide sufficient touch target size for buttons to make them easy to tap. Apple recommends a minimum target area of 44 points by 44 points.
Maintain consistent spacing between buttons and other interface elements to avoid accidental taps.

Button States:
Buttons should provide visual feedback to indicate their state. Common states include default, highlighted, selected, and disabled.
Use appropriate visual cues such as color changes, shadows, or animations to differentiate between button states.

Button Icons:
Icons can be used alongside text in buttons to enhance clarity and provide visual cues.
Use standard system icons whenever possible to ensure consistency and familiarity.

Button Interactions:
Buttons should respond to user interaction with appropriate animations or visual feedback.
Avoid using buttons for non-actionable elements or content that is better suited for other interface components like labels or images.
